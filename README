node.js service broker and provisioner

simple scalable example setup:
 
* one provisioning server (examples/provisioner
* multiple worker service proxies (examples/proxy.js)
* multiple clients (examples/trigger.js)
* a pubsub messagebus, redis implementation included

typical workflow:

1. client picks a random channel name.
2. client tells the provisioner that it expects a specific service running on that channel.
3. provisioner then tells one of all available proxies to start that service up on that channel.
4. client talks directly to service on selected channel.
